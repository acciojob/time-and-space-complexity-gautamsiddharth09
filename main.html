	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	
	<p>
		Time complexity is an measures alogorith's execution time. 
		It is related to program runs time.Our work is make the code more 
		efficient and reduce the time complexity for more readable. 
	</p>

		<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> measures the 
		memory it uses, also in relation to the input 
		size.Using O(n) is providing a standardized way to evaluate algorithm 
		efficiency independently of machine-specific factors.
