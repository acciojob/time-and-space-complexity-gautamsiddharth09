	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	
	<p>
		Time complexity is  understood as the time taken by a program to run and complte the given task.As a programer, our goal is reduce to time complexity of the code by optimization it and make it more  efficient. 
	</p>

		<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> is related to the ammount of memory occupied by the program. For example if a program take an array of size n as input then the space complexity become O(n).
